    <h1>Jenny's Personal Website</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Jenny, and I was born in New York City in January. I grew up in Queens, 
        surrounded by many of my friends. Even as a local New Yorker, there are still so many 
        places in the city I haven't explored yet, though there are plenty I've been to and loved. 
        I'm currently a senior at New York University, majoring in Data Science, and I see myself 
        working in a marketing department to help optimize campaigns through data-driven insights.
        Outside of academics, I enjoy several creative hobbies. Recently, I've started journaling 
        as a way to destress. Instead of going to the gym, I prefer dancing as a fun and active 
        alternative. One of my personal goals is to travel and experience different cultures 
        around the world.
