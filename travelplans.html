    <h2>Cities</h2>
    <ul>
        <!--Rome description-->
        <li><strong>Rome</strong>
            <p>In Rome, I'd love to see the iconic Colosseum and explore other historic landmarks and structures.</p>
        </li>

        <!--Venice description-->
        <li><strong>Venice</strong>
            <p>I've seen many posts about the local shops, and it looks like a really fun and vibrant shopping area.</p>
        </li>
        
        <!--Milan description-->
        <li><strong>Milan</strong>
            <p>Milan is home to many cathedrals and castles that I'd love to visit. Plus, there are plenty of 
                shopping centers for me to explore as well.

        <!--Florence description-->
        <li><strong>Florence</strong>
            <p>I own a perfume from a local brand that's only found in Florence. I'd love to explore more 
                of their offerings and take in the beautiful scenery the city has to offer.
