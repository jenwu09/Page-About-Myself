    <p>
        I enjoy journaling as a way to destress. My journal is often decorated with washi tapes, 
        stickers, and images that relate to the content. I typically write entries when something 
        fun or interesting happens, like hanging out with friends. During stressful times, I turn 
        to journaling to write it all out, using it as a form of meditation and reflection.

    <h2>Dancing</h2>

        I find going to the gym a bit intimidating, so instead, I dance at home as an alternative workout. 
        I usually follow a playlist of K-pop dances for cardio. The YouTube playlist includes dance practices, 
        and I simply follow along. It's a fun and energetic way to stay active.

    <p>
        In the past two years, I picked up reading as a hobby. It's quite relaxing and helps me empathize
        with different characters. One of my favorite genres to read is mystery/thriller. A book I recently
        finished is listed below.
